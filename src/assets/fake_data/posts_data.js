    The concept of AI is not new. It dates back to ancient times when philosophers and mathematicians pondered the possibility of creating intelligent machines. However, the formal inception of AI as a field of study is traced to 1956, during the Dartmouth Conference organized by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon. This event marked the beginning of AI research, aiming to construct machines that could perform tasks requiring human intelligence.

    \br Early AI research focused on symbolic AI or "good old-fashioned AI" (GOFAI), which involved programming explicit rules and logic. This approach saw some success in areas like game playing and theorem proving but struggled with real-world complexity and ambiguity. The limitations of symbolic AI led to the exploration of machine learning (ML) in the 1980s, a subfield of AI that emphasizes the ability of machines to learn from data rather than being explicitly programmed.

    The concept of AI is not new. It dates back to ancient times when philosophers and mathematicians pondered the possibility of creating intelligent machines. However, the formal inception of AI as a field of study is traced to 1956, during the Dartmouth Conference organized by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon. This event marked the beginning of AI research, aiming to construct machines that could perform tasks requiring human intelligence.

    The concept of AI is not new. It dates back to ancient times when philosophers and mathematicians pondered the possibility of creating intelligent machines. However, the formal inception of AI as a field of study is traced to 1956, during the Dartmouth Conference organized by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon. This event marked the beginning of AI research, aiming to construct machines that could perform tasks requiring human intelligence.
